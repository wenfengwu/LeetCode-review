# The count-and-say sequence is a sequence of digit strings defined by the recursive formula:

# countAndSay(1) = "1"
# countAndSay(n) is the way you would "say" the digit string from countAndSay(n-1), which is then converted into a different digit string.
# To determine how you "say" a digit string, split it into the minimal number of groups so that each group is a contiguous section all of the same character. Then for each group, say the number of characters, then say the character. To convert the saying into a digit string, replace the counts with a number and concatenate every saying.

# Example 1:

# Input: n = 1
# Output: "1"
# Explanation: This is the base case.
# Example 2:

# Input: n = 4
# Output: "1211"
# Explanation:
# countAndSay(1) = "1"
# countAndSay(2) = say "1" = one 1 = "11"
# countAndSay(3) = say "11" = two 1's = "21"
# countAndSay(4) = say "21" = one 2 + one 1 = "12" + "11" = "1211"
 

# Constraints:

# 1 <= n <= 30
